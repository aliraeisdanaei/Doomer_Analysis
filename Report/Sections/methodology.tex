\subsection{The Data}
The best place to study the doomer is its subforum on Reddit, /r/doomer. To compare the doomer with other similar characteristics, the subforums of, /r/lonely, /r/loneliness, and /r/depression were also scraped.

All the data was filtered for posts that were of greater length than 500. The data is described in table 1.
