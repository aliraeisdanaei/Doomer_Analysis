\subsection{The Data}
The best place to study the doomer is its subforum on Reddit, /r/doomer. To compare the doomer with other similar characteristics, the subforums of, /r/lonely, /r/loneliness, and /r/depression were also scraped.

All the data was filtered for posts that were of greater length than 500. The data is described in table \ref{tab:metadata}.

\begin{table}[h]

    \begin{tabular}[]{c | c | c | c | c | c | c}
        \toprule
        Subreddit & N. of Posts $\ge$ 500 words & Earliest & Oldest & Ave. Post Length & N. of Users \\
        \midrule
        /r/doomer & 1000 & 2002 & 2020 & 600 & 1000 \\
        /r/lonely & 1000 & 2002 & 2020 & 600 & 1000 \\
