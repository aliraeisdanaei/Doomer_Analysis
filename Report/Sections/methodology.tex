\subsection{The Data}
The best place to study the doomer is its subforum on Reddit, /r/doomer. To compare the doomer with other similar characteristics, the subforums of, /r/lonely, /r/loneliness, and /r/depression were also scraped.

All the data was filtered for posts that were of greater length than 500. The data is described in table \ref{tab:metadata}.
The users of Reddit, and specifically these Subreddits, skew towards young, English-speaking, males. 

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}[]{| c | c | c | c | c | c | c}
        \toprule
        Subreddit & N. of Posts $\ge$ 500 words & Ave. Post Length & Earliest & Oldest & N. of Users \\
        \midrule
        /r/doomer & 2921 & 1275.15 & \date{2019-04-22} & \date{2022-11-15} & 1764 \\
        /r/lonely & 4860 & 1228.02 & \date{2022-09-13} & \date{2022-11-17} & 3759 \\
        /r/loneliness & 2754 & 1489.41 & \date{2011-11-09} & \date{2022-11-15} & 2252 \\
        /r/depression & 8811 & 1336.82 & \date{2022-02-28} & \date{2022-11-15} & 8168 \\
        \bottomrule

\subsection{Approach}
To start off, the posts were manually examined by a human to identify some causes and themes from the different Subreddits. 
This approach is similar to Fardghassemi's analysing of the interviews \cite{fardghassemi_interviews}.

When the causes have then been identified from the manual approach, a list of terms will be identified.
These terms will be analysed for their frequencies in a similar approach to the work of Guntuku \cite{twitter_loneliness}.
If terms pertaining to one cause always have a higher frequency than another in one Subbreddit over another, it is clear that cause is more prevalent. 

Thirdly, a composition of the causes are created for a doomer, lonely person, and depressed person, as the measure of the frequency of the terms in the corpus of posts. This data could be used to train a model to classify a doomer from the other categories. This would answer the research question of the doomer having a distinct and novel identity.
