\begin{quotation}
    The prophetic vision of the holy executioner finally begins to take shape and unfold
    Nothing remains to view the final breaths of a dying star many eons after all signs
    of life ceased their existence on the surface of our beautiful planet
    leaving behind a still silhouette of memory of a once magnificently brilliant world
    The prophetic vision of the holy executioner finally begins to take shape and unfold where the monochrome deafening silence echoes throughout the remnants of what was our beautiful world.

	\noindent
	An exiled hermit\\
	These desolate plains I roam\\
	From the cosmic infancy\\
	I float like a lost comet\\
	Drifting through empty space\\
	Deprived of self\\
	I find solace within painful memory\\
	Of my sadistic lover,\\
	Life\\
	The ghost of ecstasy\\
	Lurking in the sorrows\\
	Which belong to me alone\\
	To serve as the gate to the firmament\\
	And contain the flames of agony\\
	In which I've forged the poisoned knife\\
	With which I'll put the suicidal god\\
	Out of its eternal misery\\
	Before abandoning the heavens\\
	Consumed by the flames of my passion\\
	Casting a shadow to eclipse the sun\\
	Burning brighter than the morning star\\
	At the edges of the dawn\\
	To break free from the chains of blind devotion\\
	devouring the minds of man\\
	That shall signal the inevitable collapse of tyranny\\
	Of paradise and hell\\
	Born out our asymmetry\\
	In ascendancy\\
