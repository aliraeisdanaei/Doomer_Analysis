\subsection{On the Shoulder of Giants}
This subsection will peruse the existing work to solidify how this project builds on literature in a novel way. 

Karel Němeček's work is a theoretical analysis of memes and Doomers as social and cultural icons \cite{memes_reservoir}.
This project wishes to quantify the themes and causes in a computational method through textual analysis.

To study the causes of loneliness, Fardghassemi interviewed a group of 48 young adults from London's most deprived boroughs. The interviews were manually analysed for themes and causes of youth loneliness \cite{fardghassemi_interviews}.
This work wishes to compete with the interview style analysis of young adults at a higher scale.
Scraping the internet, particularly the Reddit's subforum,
\href{www.reddit.com/r/doomer}{/r/rdoomer},
can produce a higher number of personal accounts of substantial length at a lower cost.

Guntuku has a similar approach, in which she uses NLP to analyse the themes of twitter users posting about loneliness \cite{twitter_loneliness}.
This work wishes to use her approach to answer a cultural question about the novelty of Doomerism.

\subsection{The Doomer Subreddit as a Study Ground}

On this subforum, there are personal accounts of loneliness, that stretch far into the time when the doomer was conceptualised. 
These personal accounts are to the same quality as the interviews produced by Fardghassemi \textit{et al.}

Thus, there are simply more information available to analyse for a lower cost. To analyse the high quality posts concerning the scope of the research under this forum, can give substantial results.
Causes may be discovered that were missed in the narrow number of participants in previous research led by traditional interviews.
Moreover, the information are made public by the users, the data scraped is not shared, and there is little to no invasiveness; therefore, there are less ethical considerations to be had.
