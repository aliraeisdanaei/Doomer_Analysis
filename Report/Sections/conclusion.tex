\subsection{Ethics}
The issue of ethics was closely guarded for this research.
The people in consideration for this research are vulnerable groups; therefore no data created for this research has been shared. 
Moreover, all notes created for the analysis of these posts have also been made private. 
For the most part, identifiable features of the posts were hidden and discussed.

All the data, that was used, are made public by the users themselves, and free software and widely available scrapers were used to retrieve that data. 
Any person could have access to the posts made by these users.
